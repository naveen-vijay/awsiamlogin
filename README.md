AWS IAM Login
===================

**https://naveen-vijay.github.io/awsiamlogin/** aims at providing easy access to manage and navigate across multiple *Amazon Web Services (AWS)* Accounts and bookmarking. AWS strongly recommends usage of IAM Access and the structure of the AWS IAM Login Portal or with AWS Alias; for which the URL isnâ€™t rememberable (easily) thus leaning towards the usage of root account.
